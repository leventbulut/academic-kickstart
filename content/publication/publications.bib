	abstract = {In this paper, we use Google Trends data for exchange rate forecasting in the context of a broad literature review that ties the exchange rate movements with macroeconomic fundamentals. The sample covers 11 OECD countries’ exchange rates for the period from January 2004 to June 2014. In out-of-sample forecasting of monthly returns on exchange rates, our findings indicate that the Google Trends search query data do a better job than the structural models in predicting the true direction of changes in nominal exchange rates. We also observed that Google Trends-based forecasts are better at picking up the direction of the changes in the monthly nominal exchange rates after the Great Recession era (2008–2009). Based on the Clark and West inference procedure of equal predictive accuracy testing, we found that the relative performance of Google Trends-based exchange rate predictions against the null of a random walk model is no worse than the purchasing power parity model. On the other hand, although the monetary model fundamentals could beat the random walk null only in one out of 11 currency pairs, with Google Trends predictors we found evidence of better performance for five currency pairs. We believe that these findings necessitate further research in this area to investigate the extravalue one can get from Google search query data.},

	abstract = {In this article, we contribute to the current literature on market disciplining of the sovereign governments of the developing countries by distinguishing both sides of the market discipline hypothesis by adopting three-stage least square estimation to incorporate the contemporaneous feedback effects between primary structural budget balances and the country's default-risk premiums. We provide empirical evidence of a unidirectional causal relationship between a country's default-risk premium and primary structural budget balances with the direction flowing from primary structural budget balances to country's risk premium in 40 developing countries over the period 1975–2008. We also employ the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel generalized methods of moments estimation to control for this joint determination of primary structural budget balances and the country's default-risk premium, and find supportive evidence of undisciplined sovereign governments and of nonlinearly behaving well-functioning financial markets in the sample countries.

	abstract = {We examine a class of popular structural models of exchange rate determination and compare them to a random walk with and without drift. Given almost any set of conditioning variables, we find parametric specifications fail. Our findings are based on a broad entropy function of the whole distribution of variables and forecasts. We also find significant evidence of nonlinearity and/or “higher moment” influences which seriously questions the habit of forecast and model evaluation based on mean-variance criteria. Taylor rule factors may improve out of sample “forecasts” for some models and exchanges, but do not offer similar improvement for in-sample (historical) fit. We estimate models of exchange rate determination nonparametrically so as to avoid functional form issues. Taylor rule and some other variables are smoothed out, being statistically irrelevant in sample. The metric entropy tests suggest significant differences between the observed densities and their in- and out- of sample forecasts and fitted values. Much like the Diebold-Mariano approach, we are able to report statistical significance of the differences with our more general measures of forecast performance.},

We utilize an approach where net external-debt positions dampen the widening of the current account balances. In a simple accounting framework, we find supportive evidence of the adjustment role of the net external-debt positions on the current account balances. Our findings show that net external-debt holdings affect current account imbalances through their effect on private consumption. Government expenditure and domestic investment, on the other hand, are not negatively affected by net external-debt holdings. We show that, on average, developing countries in the sample would have run a 2.7 percentage points wider current account deficit in the absence of the negative impact of net external debts. Net external-debt positions, therefore, reduce the dispersions of current account imbalances and thus increase the correlation of investment and saving ratios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

We assess forecasting performance of Google Trends based models against random walk null on Turkish Lira–US Dollar exchange rate for the period of January 2004 to August 2015. We offer a three-step methodology for query selection for macro fundamentals in Turkey and the US. In out-of-sample forecasting, results show better performance against no-change random walk predictions for specifications both when we use Google Trends data as the only exchange rate predictor or augment it with exchange rate fundamentals. We also find that Google Trends data has limited predictive power when used in year-on-year growth rate format.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The simulation results show that even though the mean squared prediction errors of a constructed superior model is far below a weaker alternative, the Clark- West test does not reflect this in their test statistics. Therefore, studies that use this statistic in testing the predictive accuracy of alternative exchange rate models, stock return predictability, inflation forecasting, and unemployment forecasting should not weight too much on the magnitude of the statistically significant Clark-West tests statistics.},

	abstract = {By modelling the current account balances (as a percentage of GDP) in a dynamic AR(1) model, Taylor (2002) proposed to use speed of mean reversion of the dynamics of the current account as a tool for measurement of capital mobility and confirmed the stylized fact of U-Shape degree of capital mobility through the last two centuries with this new approach. With the assumption that countries obey their Long-Run Budget Constraint (LRBC), the OLS estimate of the degree of current account persistency in Taylor (2002) is downward bias due to small sample and high serial correlation of current account ratios with its lags. By correcting these biases with the Andrews (1993) exact median-unbiased estimation, we find that the confidence intervals for half-life estimates include 1 year (which was used as a benchmark) in 37 out of 75 country–period cases, which cast some doubt on the use of half-life estimate as a practical measure of capital mobility.},
